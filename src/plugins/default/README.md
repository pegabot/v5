# Plugin: `Default`

This is the default plugin which contains all the default commands and events which are the foundation for this bot to be functional. If you want to add extra features `(e.g. commands)` create a new plugin instead.

This plugin needs an environmental variable:

Add this to your runtime envs and to the `.env` file in the root of this repository for development:
```
INVITE_LINK=<add the invite link for your bot here>
```
