# Pegabot's second generation

In 2020, Pegasus Spiele launched its successful online convention CONspiracy, where thousands of enthusiastic pen & paper, board and card game fans competed. At the same time, the Pegabot was launched. He took over important organizational tasks and made the game rounds easier for the players by rolling the dice for them and much more.

Unfortunately, there were some bottlenecks that didn't allow the first generation bot to be multilingual or to be on multiple Discord servers at once. 

The second generation of @pegabot (v5) addresses these issues within its core and provides a robust platform for future extensions through a sophisticated plugin system.
